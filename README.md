# InfraWatch

This project is a monorepo structure built using Turborepo. It's optimized for efficient development and build processes.

## 📦 What is Turborepo?

Turborepo is a high-performance build system designed for JavaScript and TypeScript monorepos. It accelerates the development process with intelligent caching and parallel task execution.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

This monorepo includes the following packages and applications:

### Applications
- `apps/web`: Web application built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) + [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- `apps/api`: Express.js API server with TypeScript

### Shared Packages
- `@repo/ui`: React component library used by all applications
- `@repo/eslint-config`: ESLint configurations (includes eslint-config-next and eslint-config-prettier)
- `@repo/typescript-config`: TypeScript configurations used throughout the monorepo

All packages and applications are written in 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## 🛠️ Utilities and Tools

This project uses the following tools:

- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: Static type checking
- **[ESLint](https://eslint.org/)**: Code quality and standards
- **[Prettier](https://prettier.io)**: Code formatting
- **[PNPM](https://pnpm.io)**: Fast and disk space efficient package manager

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

```bash
# Install dependencies for the entire monorepo
pnpm install
```

### Environment Setup

Before starting the development environment, you need to set up your environment variables:

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit the .env file with your specific configuration
# The .env.example file contains all available environment variables with example values
```

**Important**: The `.env` file contains sensitive information and should never be committed to version control. Always use `.env.example` as a template.

### Starting Development Environment

```bash
# Start development server for all applications
pnpm dev

# Or use turbo command
turbo dev

# Run only the web application
turbo dev --filter=web
```

### Building

```bash
# Build all applications and packages
pnpm build

# Or use turbo command
turbo build

# Build only a specific package
turbo build --filter=web
```

### Starting Production

```bash
# Start production server after building
pnpm start

# Or use turbo command
turbo start
```

## 🔧 Turbo Commands

The project supports the following core turbo commands:

- `turbo dev` - Starts development servers
- `turbo build` - Creates production builds
- `turbo start` - Starts production servers
- `turbo lint` - Runs code quality checks
- `turbo test` - Runs tests

### Working with Specific Packages using Filtering

```bash
# For web application only
turbo dev --filter=web
turbo build --filter=web

# For UI package
turbo build --filter=@repo/ui
```

## 🔄 Development Workflow

This project follows a structured Git workflow for development. Here's the step-by-step process:

### 1. Create Feature Branch

```bash
# Create and switch to a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Example: git checkout -b feature/user-authentication
```

### 2. Development Process

```bash
# Make your changes
# Add files
# Test your changes locally

# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication system

- Add login and register components
- Implement JWT token handling
- Add protected route wrapper
- Update navigation for authenticated users"
```

### 3. Push Feature Branch

```bash
# Push branch to remote
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 4. Create Pull Request

When you push a feature branch, GitHub will provide a link to create a Pull Request:

```
Create a pull request for 'feature/your-feature-name' on GitHub by visiting:
https://github.com/ilcann/infrawatch/pull/new/feature/your-feature-name
```

**Pull Request Template:**
- **Title**: Use conventional commits format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.)
- **Description**: Include detailed explanation of changes
- **Add GitHub Copilot as Reviewer**: Always add `@github-copilot` as a reviewer for automated code review

### 5. Review Process

1. **Automated Review**: GitHub Copilot will automatically review your code
2. **Team Review**: Wait for human reviewers to approve
3. **Address Feedback**: Make necessary changes based on review comments
4. **Update PR**: Push additional commits if needed

### 6. Merge Pull Request

After approval, merge the Pull Request:

```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Merge feature branch (if merging locally)
git merge feature/your-feature-name

# Push merged changes
git push origin main

# Clean up: Delete local feature branch
git branch -d feature/your-feature-name

# Clean up: Delete remote feature branch
git push origin --delete feature/your-feature-name
```

### 📋 Pull Request Checklist

Before creating a Pull Request, ensure:

- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] Documentation is updated if needed
- [ ] Commit messages follow conventional format
- [ ] GitHub Copilot is added as reviewer
- [ ] PR description clearly explains the changes
- [ ] No sensitive data is committed

### 🤖 GitHub Copilot Integration

This project uses GitHub Copilot for automated code reviews:

1. **Automatic Assignment**: Copilot is automatically assigned as a reviewer
2. **Code Analysis**: Provides suggestions for code improvements
3. **Security Scanning**: Identifies potential security issues
4. **Best Practices**: Ensures code follows established patterns

To enable Copilot reviews:
- Add `@github-copilot` as a reviewer in every Pull Request
- Address Copilot's suggestions before requesting human review
- Use Copilot's feedback to improve code quality

## ☁️ Remote Caching

Turborepo uses [Remote Caching](https://turborepo.com/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) technology to share build caches between team members and CI/CD pipelines.

### Setting up Remote Cache

1. Login to your Vercel account:
```bash
turbo login
```

2. Link your project with Remote Cache:
```bash
turbo link
```

This significantly reduces build times and enables cache sharing among team members.
